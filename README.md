# Knowledge Weaver

Knowledge Weaver is a Chrome extension designed to help you capture, organize, and connect your ideas as you browse the web. It aims to be a powerful tool for personal knowledge management, leveraging AI to automatically categorize your notes and build a knowledge graph.

## Phase 1: Core Functionality (In Progress)

This initial phase focuses on building the core features of the extension, allowing for local use and basic note-taking.

### Current Features

#### Core Note-Taking
*   **Note-Taking Popup:** A simple popup allows you to jot down notes quickly.
*   **Hotkey Access:** Use `Ctrl+Shift+Y` to open the note-taking popup.
*   **Contextual Notes:** The title, URL, and summary (if available) of the current webpage are automatically added to your note.
*   **Auto-Focus:** The note-taking area is automatically focused when the popup is opened, allowing you to start typing immediately.
*   **Enter to Save & Close:** Press `Enter` in the note area to quickly save your note and close the popup.
*   **Modern UI:** A sleek, modern interface built with Tailwind CSS featuring a dark theme, smooth animations, and intuitive design.
*   **Local Storage:** Notes are saved to the extension's local storage.
*   **View Notes:** You can view all your notes on a dedicated page.
*   **Edit and Delete Notes:** You can easily edit and delete your notes from the "View Notes" page. Editing is done in a new, centered pop-up window for a better experience.
*   **Export Notes:** You can export all your notes as a single Markdown file.

#### Advanced Category Management
*   **Enhanced Categories UI:** Comprehensive category management interface with modern design
*   **Manual Category Creation:** Add new categories with custom names and definitions
*   **Category CRUD Operations:** Create, Read, Update, and Delete categories through the UI
*   **Modal Editing:** Edit categories in a sleek modal interface

*   **Built-in API Tester:** Test categorization directly from the categories page
*   **CORS Support:** Proper CORS configuration for browser-based API access
*   **Health Check Endpoint:** Monitor server health and availability
*   **RESTful API Design:** Full REST API with proper HTTP methods and status codes

### FastAPI Server

A local FastAPI server handles automatic categorization and category management. This project uses `pdm` for Python package management.

#### Setup & Installation
1.  Install `pdm` if you haven't already: `pip install pdm`
2.  Install the dependencies: `pdm install`
3.  Create a `.env` file in the root of the project and add your DeepSeek API key: `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=your_api_key`
4.  Run the server: `pdm run python api/api.py`

The server will run on `http://localhost:8000`.

#### API Endpoints
*   `GET /health` - Health check endpoint
*   `GET /categories` - Get all categories
*   `POST /categories` - Add a new category
*   `PUT /categories/{index}` - Update a category by index
*   `DELETE /categories/{index}` - Delete a category by index
*   `POST /categorize` - Categorize a note using AI
*   `GET /docs` - Interactive API documentation (Swagger UI)

#### Using the API Documentation
1.  Start the FastAPI server
2.  Visit `http://localhost:8000/docs` in your browser
3.  Explore and test all API endpoints interactively
4.  View request/response schemas and try out different API calls

### Storage Limits

This extension uses `chrome.storage.local` to store your notes. This storage is not unlimited and has the following restrictions:

*   **Total storage:** 5 MB
*   **Individual item size:** 8 KB
*   **Number of items:** 512

If you plan to store a large number of notes, you may eventually hit these limits. Future versions of the extension will offer alternative storage options, such as a dedicated database.

5.  Click "Save Note" or press `Enter` to save the note and close the popup.
6.  Click "View Notes" to see all your saved notes.
7.  Click "Export Notes" to save all your notes to a single Markdown file.

**Category Management**
